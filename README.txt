Homework 3

I'm not sure if you said that we needed this so here it is.

The Main page checks to see if the user is logged in and if they are then put their
userid in the header and a logout button next to it. If there is no user is logged
in then put a login button in the header.

The master page checks to see if there is data inputted into the Caption and URL 
variables. If there is something then display it underneath the title otherwise
display nothing.
